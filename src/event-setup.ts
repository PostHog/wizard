    `Let's get the basics of event tracking ready in your app. We'll generate a plan you can follow yourself, or with the help of an agent. You can always edit it later.
    
    To start, let's decide on a ${chalk.bold('North Star metric')}. A good North Star measures whether your product is on the right track.
    
    Examples:
    
    - ${chalk.bold('Total rides')} - Perfect for a ride-sharing app.
    - ${chalk.bold('Daily active users')} - Great for a social media platform.
    - ${chalk.bold('Signups')} - A good starting point for a very early-stage app.
    
    What top-level number could we track to measure the progress of your product?
